# Agent-Bank
Non-developer LLM assisted structural design for AI Agents 
This repository contains code and resources for building a base blockchain agent using Solidity. The goal is to create a simple smart contract that can be extended with AI features like machine learning and natural language processing. Check the BaseAgent.sol file for the initial contract code." That should do itâ€”just paste that into your README.md file on GitHub.
